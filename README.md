Assignment CD

I had no problems with creating and provisioning a server at Digital Ocean. Its pretty much straight forward. It was no problem to make contact with the VPS trough the terminal. But to push and add the changes with VSC I had some trouble. A lot of trouble I had with the build and deploy section in Github. I coudn't get it working. I read some old documentation and did the assignments before the end assignment probably 10 times before I got it right. Also I did the step by step setup https://dev.to/knowbee/how-to-setup-continuous-deployment-of-a-website-on-a-vps-using-github-actions-54im over 10 times!
And finally I got it!

Beacause ,in the end, it wasn't difficult I doubted myself. I don't know why, mayby because I had problems with the assignments before which ,in the end, I finished with a good grade. But I learned the most by searching and reading from the internet.

I had some help from slack but most of all google was my friend. As specialy this assignment. while I writting this I still doubt myself if I didn't correct.

The first problem I run into was to push and add changes with the terminal in VSC. I hadn't done this for a while and I had to go back in the course and did some assignments. After that it was no problem. Pratice makes perfect!!
Next problem I ran into was to understand the working of Github in relation to the actions and than especialy the .yml file. No I understand that this file is the file that gives the "orders". I struggle a long time with this and after reading, trail and run many times it's was solved.

Once I had a good working .yml file the rest was easy and soon after that I received a green light that I, build and deploy my website.

Great learning experince!!
